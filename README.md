# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Program
By Leena AlQasem


# PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE
This program has been created specifically for students who are interested in machine learning, AI, and/or deep learning, and who have a working knowledge of Python programming, including NumPy and pandas. Outside of that Python expectation and some familiarity with calculus and linear algebra, it's a beginner-friendly program.

## Introduction
Get your first taste of deep learning by applying style transfer to your own images, and gain experience using development tools such as Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks.

## Neural Networks
Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.

### Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns (Project)
Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.
