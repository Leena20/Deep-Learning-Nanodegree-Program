# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Program
By Leena AlQasem


### PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE
"This program has been created specifically for students who are interested in machine learning, AI, and/or deep learning, and who have a working knowledge of Python programming, including NumPy and pandas. Outside of that Python expectation and some familiarity with calculus and linear algebra, it's a beginner-friendly program."

## Introduction
"First taste of deep learning by applying style transfer to your own images, and gain experience using development tools such as Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks."

## Neural Networks
"Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data."

#### - [1st (Project): Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/Leena20/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/project-bikesharing-patterns) 
"Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day."

## Convolutional Neural Networks
"Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based on patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image denoising."

#### - [2nd (Project): Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media](https://github.com/LeenaAAlQasem/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/Landmark%20Classification%20%26%20Tagging%20for%20Social%20Media)
"In the project, you will go through a machine learning design process end-to-end: performing data preprocessing and augmentation, designing your own CNN from scratch, and training and saving your best CNN model. You will also use transfer learning and compare your transfer-learned model with your from-scratch CNN."

## Recurrent Neural Networks
"Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts."

#### - [3rd (Project): Generate TV scripts](https://github.com/LeenaAAlQasem/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/dlnd_tv_script_generation)
"Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts."

## Generative Adversarial Networks
"Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs."

#### - 4th (Project): Generate Faces
"Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with!"

## Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
"Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website." 

#### - 5th (Project): Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
"Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. Youâ€™ll build a model and create a gateway for accessing it from a website."
